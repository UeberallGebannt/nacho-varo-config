# This is the knockback configuration file for NachoSpigot.
# As you can see, there isn't much to configure. To add/remove/edit a knockback profile
# you must use the /kb command. Note that this will impact gameplay so use caution and 
# make sure you know what each option does before configuring.
# 
# If you need help with the configuration or have any questions related to NachoSpigot,
# feel free to join us in our Discord.
